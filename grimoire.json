"text":"Req: Muto\nSpecial: Requires Hermetic Metamorphosis Virtue\nThis spell can only be successfully cast by those with\nthe Hermetic Metamorphosis Virtue. It requires the\nimmobilized body of the recipient animal, and the\ndonor organ. If the donor derives from another animal,\nit too must be immobilized. During the casting of the\nspell, the caster removes the organ from the donor and\ngrafts it to the recipient. The spell resizes the organ (if\nnecessary) and joins up the blood supply and internal\norgans. The type of organs that can be transplanted are\nfunctional units of the animal — its head, pair of hind\nlegs, tail, pair of hands, heart, and so forth. A\nreplacement organ involves the removal of the\nrecipient's organ and putting the donor organ in its\nplace. If the caster wishes he may take the recipient's\noriginal organ and put it in the space left on the donor,\nbut this requires two surgical rolls (see below), one for\neach animal. A transposed organ involves the recipient\ngaining an organ without removing something first;\nfor example, giving it a pair of wings or a second head.\nThe donor animal (if any) dies as a result of this type\nof surgery. Magical surgery of this type can be purely\nanatomical, or else confer a Virtue from the donor to\nthe recipient. An anatomical change can grant the\nrecipient a new ability (such as flight) or a Quality (see\nHouses of Hermes: Mystery Cults, pages 40–43). A\nVirtue can be any General Virtue that derives from the\nbody of the animal; such as Keen Vision, Long-\nWinded, or Tough. A donor who loses a Virtue due to\nthis spell receives the Enfeebled Flaw if it survives the\nsurgery. The ritual surgery performed as part of the\nmagical actions of casting this spell needs to be\nperformed accurately to ensure the success of the spell.\nThis requires a Dexterity + Chirurgy roll against an\nEase Factor of 9. If the organ is transposed rather than\nreplaced, the Ease Factor has a +3 modifier. If the\nsurgery grants a Virtue rather than an anatomical\nchange, the Ease Factor has an additional +3 modifier.\nIf the surgery roll fails then the animal dies soon after\nthe casting of the spell. If the surgery roll botches, then\nthe spell creates some dreadful monster instead.\nExample: Marcus wishes to swap the head of a lion\nand an eagle in his first step to creating a griffin.\nEagles have the Keen Vision Virtue, so this is more\nthan simple anatomical surgery. To successfully\nimplant the eagle's head on the lion's body, his\nsurgery roll has an Ease Factor of 12. He needs only\na 9 to successfully implant the lion's head on the\neagle's body, but the lion-headed eagle that results\nsuffers from the Enfeebled Flaw. The spell\ncompensates for the vast difference in size between the\ntwo heads.\n(Base 25, +1 Touch, +1 Muto requisite)",

The Arcane\nConnection used must intimately relate to the target\nbloodline; a crown for a royal line, a sword passed\nfrom father to son, earth from a family estate, and so\non. Once summoned, the spirit can be questioned or\ncommanded as normal and if it is powerful enough it\nshould have knowledge of the true heir to the line.\nShould the magus wish it, he may also be able to\ncommand other information from the spirit concerning\nthose who share its blood.\n(Base 15, +4 Arcane Connection, +2 Ring)",

"text":"Req: Imaginem\nThis spell affects a single fire, turning the very tips of\nthe flames into pleasing music. The caster decides the\nkind of music he wishes to hear (a ballad, a whirly jig,\netc.), and the spell accommodates. The music of the\nflames always incorporates a signature refrain, as\nthough a sigil, with each casting. But the mood of that\nsame refrain is adapted to the needs of the song.\nThe flames play the same music all the while the fire\nburns, getting louder as the fire burns brighter, hotter,\nor larger, though the random nature of fire and\ndifferences in fuel mean that no two castings ever\nproduce exactly the same performance.\nThe spell ends when the flame is extinguished, its\noriginal source is fully destroyed or, for particularly\nlong-burning fires, when the spell's Sun Duration\nnaturally expires. This spell cannot affect a fire that is\nalready larger than a campfire or a fire in a hearth\n(essentially, any fire doing +5 damage), but a fire that\ngrows larger than this retains the magic.\nYestin originally designed this spell so that his fire,\nwhether on the road or in his sanctum, could gently\nsing him to sleep. But the more he explored this new\nspell, the more he found new uses for it. It wasn't just\nmusic that the flames could produce, but also speech\n(though limited in the range of words and voice to little\nmore than those the caster imagines as he casts the\nspell) or other natural and unnatural sounds. These\nsounds always adopt the rhythm of the spell's original\nmelody, though. If left to sing (or talk) of its own\nvolition, with no guidance from the caster, the fire\nsounds as though it is forming words, but this is an\nillusion; the sounds form true words by accident if at\nall.\nYestin has used this spell in his sanctum to experiment\nwith different harmonies, and has on occasion\nestablished choirs of candles each quietly singing a\ndifferent refrain or a different note. The effect can be\nmesmerizing.\nA Finesse Stress roll (Mastery of the spell reduces this\nto a simple roll) determines how pleasant the sound is,\nbut the size of the fire determines how loud it is.\nSize of Fire Equivalent Sound\nA candle flame A whisper\nA burning torch A conversation\nA campfire A song or heated discussion\nThis spell has the side effect of reducing the intensity\nof the target fire by 1 as flame is turned to sound.\n(Base 4, +2 Voice, +2 Sun, +1 Part)",

For example, it pulls\nnotes higher, pushes them lower, draws them out\nlonger, or cuts them off sharply.\nAs the caster must anticipate the music or song as it is\nbeing performed, the spell requires a Finesse roll to\naffect the sound to a greater or lesser degree. On a high\nFinesse roll (9 or higher), the caster is able to change\nwords within the song, or change entire chords within\nthe music. At the lowest level, the caster is able to at\nleast change some of the music to bad notes or add a\ncroak in the voice.\nFinesse Roll: 3+\nEffect: Causes occasional breaks in the voice or the\nrandom bad or missed note.\nFinesse Roll: 6+\nEffect: The caster can choose to manipulate the\nperformance such that it appears to simply be\na good player on a bad night. The target voice\nmight sound strained or croaky, and\ninstruments may sound in need of tuning.\nFinesse Roll: 9+\nEffect: The caster can make the singer sound tone\ndeaf, flattening a performance or pitching the\nmusic off key.\nFinesse Roll: 12+\nEffect: The caster achieves a fine level of control,\nand can even change words within a song to\nany other words of his choosing.\nIf the caster is familiar with the song or the piece of\nmusic, he may add his Music score to his Finesse roll\nas there is less need to anticipate the performance.\nIt may be possible to apply the spell to the spoken\nword, perhaps to an orator or a tutor as he addresses an\naudience, although Yestin has not yet experimented\nwith this.\n(Base 1, +3 Sight, +1 Concentration)",

That\nperson may not necessarily be the caster of the spell,\nand will most likely be someone the target feels he can\ntrust.\nThe Infernal and the Dominion have a strong impact\non this spell, dealing as they do with the moral aspects\nof human life. If the target spends time in the\nDominion, the light of the Lord helps to release the\ntruth and the level of the aura is subtracted from the\ntarget's roll. The aura's Temper (see Realms of Power:\nThe Divine, page 38) also has an effect with Brave,\nWise, Strong, or Just Tempers, increasing the aura's\neffect by 1.\nIf the target spends the duration of the spell within an\nInfernal aura, the corrupting influence of the aura\nreinforces the target's resolve to keep the secret. The\nlevel of the aura is added to the target's roll. The\nStoryguide may impose a further bonus to the roll\nbased on any Tarnish or Corruption of the Infernal\naura (see Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 13).\nYestin invented this spell as a means to more easily\nsolve those mysteries that the spirit Taliesin led him\ninto; mysteries often solved by knowing what those\ninvolved wished to hide.\n(Base 5, +1 Eye, +2 Sun)",

"text":"Req: Creo, Herbam\nAn entire building is reshaped to be perfect, if this can\nbe accommodated by small adjustments to the whole\nand to the rooms within. Both the exterior and the\nrooms within become regular: rightangled and with\nstraight sides, or perfectly circular. Irregularities in\nworkmanship are easily perfected, but the building is\nnot redesigned.\nNormal medieval building design often prevents this\nspell from working: most medieval buildings have\nirregular extensions and out-buildings requiring\nredesign to count as regular — although demolition of\nthe extensions is an easy corrective option. If the\nwhole structure cannot be perfected, the magus can\nusually perfect individual rooms using Perfection of\nthe Well-Designed Chamber.\nA building so perfected counts for the Ceremonial\nbonus options of Hermetic Geometry. It is also\nstronger and more stable against tremors and storms,\nand has a pleasing air to those beholding it, or living\nand working within. The magical perfection is\nmomentary, and then slowly fades as the building\nstructure decays naturally over time; for Ceremonial\npurposes most buildings remain perfected for a day or\nso before they settle slightly and lapse.\nIf there is doubt about the limits of perfection, a\nPerception + Artes Liberales (geometry) roll against\nan Ease Factor of 12 or higher resolves the issue.\n(Difficulty depends upon the irregularities that need\nperfecting, however, if the Ease Factor would be less\nthan 12 (Hard) the spell will perfect the target without\nguidance.)\nThe Mystery of Hermetic Architecture teaches how to\nenchant this effect into a building so that the\nenchantment sustains the perfection indefinitely.\n(Base 2, +1 stone, +1 Touch, +3 Structure, +1 Herbam\nreq.)",

Furthermore,\nspells that bring objects into the Aegis, including\nteleportation spells such as The Seven-League Stride,\nare also resisted unless the caster was involved in the\nritual. If the foreign spell cannot penetrate a resistance\nequal to the level of the Aegis, it fizzles out. The Aegis\nis also able to block foreign Intellego spells, even if\nthey cannot normally be blocked by a Parma Magica,\nand spells that were cast before they entered the Aegis,\nsuch as an invisibility spell cast on a magus outside the\nAegis.\nMagi who were not involved in the ritual and who cast\nspells within the Aegis must subtract half the level of\nthe Aegis from all their Casting Totals. Spells\nsuccessfully cast have otherwise normal effects (e.g.\nIgnem spells still do full damage). Penetration totals\nfor magical creatures are reduced by the same amount.\nEffects from enchanted devices are resisted by the\nAegis unless the item was within the Aegis at the time\nof casting, or was created within the Aegis by someone\nwho was part of the ritual or in possession of a token.\nCreatures with a Might score cannot enter the area\nprotected by the Aegis unless they have a higher Might\nthan the Aegis's level. When approaching the border\nof an Aegis, a magical person (including a Hermetic\nmagus) feels a slight tingle in the extremities. Magical,\nInfernal, Faerie, and Divine creatures and persons may\nbe brought within the Aegis, if they are formally\ninvited by one who participated in its casting and given\na token to represent the invitation. (The tokens are\nused during the casting of the ritual, and thus conform\nto the Law of Sympathy.) Such a person is also not\naffected by the penalty to casting within the Aegis. The\ninvitation may be withdrawn at any time. This does not\nrequire retrieving the token or even notifying the\nindividual who is no longer welcome. Withdrawing an\ninvitation will not expel the person beyond the Aegis,\nbut will prevent them from re-entering after they leave\n(unless their Might is high enough), and subject them\nto the Casting Total penalty while they are within the\nAegis. The invitation and expulsion must both be\nissued by magi who participated in the ritual, but not\nnecessarily by the same magus. A magus may only\ninvite or expel specific, known, individuals. He may\nnot expel someone he does not know has been invited\nin.\nThe Aegis is typically cast on the winter solstice, since\nmagical auras can be slightly higher at that time, and\nthe Aegis then lasts for the entire next year. The entire\ncovenant usually participates in the Aegis ritual, which\noften ends with the participants walking around the\nperimeter of the protected area in order to define it.\nQuite often, the covenant holds a major council\nmeeting, or perhaps a large feast, after the ritual of the\nAegis. Magi do not need to be able to cast the spell to\nparticipate in the ritual, and, indeed, non-Hermetic\nwizards can participate as well. Only one magus needs\nto actually cast the spell.\nAegis of the Hearth was invented by Notatus, the first\nPrimus of House Bonisagus. It was a major\nbreakthrough, incorporating Mercurian rituals as well\nas Hermetic theory, and was the reason Notatus was\nchosen to succeed Bonisagus. As a result, the spell is\nmore powerful than it ought to be, and has no Perdo\nrequisite. By 1220 Notatus's discoveries have spread,\nand any magus trained in the Order is capable of\ninventing versions of the Aegis with the above\nparameters, but at different levels. Inventing a version\nwith different parameters, however, would require a\nsimilar breakthrough, and years of research.\n(Base effect)",
