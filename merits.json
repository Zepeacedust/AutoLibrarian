The resulting effects are minor due to the nature of non-fatiguing \nSpontaneous magic but are likely to cause distraction and/or other problems. Though \nnon-fatiguing, the effort of marshaling the magic into less dangerous forms is tiring \nand the magus is considered to have lost one long-term Fatigue level which cannot \nbe regained through sleep. The effects produced by the constant expression may target \nanything that the magus could normally target with spontaneous spell, including herself, \nalthough they are more likely to target things touched by or seen by the magus. The \nmagus may actively concentrate in order to suppress this automatic magic entirely, \nmaking an initial Stamina + Concentration simple roll against Ease Factor 3 + (Warping \nScore). On a failure, a further roll is allowed every two minutes after the magus \nhas composed herself. If the magic has been suppressed, the magus may cast Spontaneous \nand Formulaic spells normally. In order to cast Ceremonial or Ritual magic the magus \nmust make a Concentration roll as described above. One attempt can be made every \n15 minutes, a successful attempt sufficient to cover the duration of the casting. \nNevertheless, the magus suffers a number of additional botch dice equal to her Warping \nScore. The constant expression of magic also makes laboratory work inherently risky. \nAny laboratory the magus works in is treated as having a free Flaw providing a Safety \npenalty of –3.  Penalties from foreign auras, or from effects such as Aegis of the \nHearth, may dampen the constant expression. Where the penalty reduces the casting \ntotal to 0, no magic is expressed. The player should decide, based on personality, \nsigil, and favored arts, how the constant expression most often manifests, though \nthe storyguide may vary the actual effect scene-by-scene.",

Many dhampirs, raised by their mothers, ﬁnd \nvampirism repulsive and strive to slay ﬁrst their fathers, then any other vampires \nof which they become aware. If a dhampir dies, they rise again as a vampire, unless \ncertain rituals have been performed on their corpse.  Vampires, like other dark faeries, \nhave vulnerabilities that vary widely, but many are affected by crossroads, doorways, \nchurch bells, sunlight or herbs.  Dhampirs have the following advantages: 1)Dhampirs \nstart making aging rolls at the age of ﬁfty, and get –3 to all rolls to resist the \neffects of aging, cumulative with any other bonuses. 2)Dhampirs have the Virtue Second \nSight, and can see normally in darkness or semi-darkness.

Dhampirs may \nhave The Gift, but House Tremere forbids the training of dhampirs as Hermetic magi. \n This is a supernatural ability, and you cannot lose it when being trained as a magus. \n If your master cannot preserve the ability, you cannot be trained.

The Initiative \nfor the power is equal to Quickness – (the magnitude of the effect x 2). The player \nshould also note the Forms of the effect, to calculate Magic Resistance. Besides \nreducing his Might Pool, Ritual Powers also require the player to subtract one from \nhis Might Score for each point in the Might cost, whenever it activates the effect. \nThis lost Might may return over time, at the storyguide discretion, but at a much \nslower rate than recovering lost Might Points. For example, the character may regain \na single point for each story in which it plays a decisive role.

The magus has access \nto a special Range: Water-way, a special Duration: Storm, and a special Target: Body-of-water, \nthat he may utilize with Spontaneous magic and in Formulaic or Ritual spells.\n\nWater-way (Range): The magus can target anyone, or anything, on (or in) the same \nwater-way as him. For example, a river, or canal, or lake, or sea is a water-way. \nTributary streams of a river are the same water-way as the main river, but are not \nthe same water-way as other tributaries to the main river. In some cases the troupe \nwill need to decide precisely where one water-way begins, and another ends.  The \nmagus must touch the water-way, when casting the spell, and the target must be either \nalso touching the water-way or floating on it (in a boat, for example). A person \non the bank of a river cannot be targeted by this spell. The magus need not be able \nto see the target, but he must be able to sense it in some way, unless the spell \nis an Intellego effect intended to determine whether something is in the water-way. \nFor determining the spell level, waterway is the same range of effect as Sight. \n\nStorm \n(Duration): A spell with this duration must be cast during a storm and lasts until \nthe end of the storm. Normally, a storm lasts a number of minutes or hours, but some \nlarge storms may last for days. The form of the spell must be either Aquam or Auram, \nbut the spell is not necessarily cast on the storm itself. The length of an entirely \nnatural storm can be quickly estimated by rolling a stress die and dividing the result \nby 2 — this gives the number of hours that the storm will last. A botch has no consequence, \nexcepting that the storm will dissipate in a number of minutes. The storyguide should \nsecretly determine how long the storm will last — although an InAu spell, or Wilderness \nSense Ability Roll could easily reveal this information. For determining the spell \nlevel, Storm is the same duration as Concentration. \n\nBody-of-water (Target): A spell with this target targets an entire body-of-water, \nwhether this is a lake, a river, or a sea. Use the same guidelines as water-way to \ndetermine where a body-of-water begins and ends. For determining the spell level, \nbody-of-water is the same level of Target as Structure (remember to increase the \nspell magnitude to effect a very large body-of-water, like a sea or the ocean).",

This \nVirtue lets the magus conceal spellcasting by using the actions or words of some \nAbility to replace the normal Hermetic gestures and words, and lets him maintain \na spell without needing Concentration rolls. When the Virtue is acquired, specify \nthe Ability to which it applies. You may choose any Craft, Profession, or other Ability \nwith a clear verbal or physical practice. You may not choose any Language, Supernatural, \nAcademic, or Arcane Ability. There are distinct Virtues for each possible Ability, \nas each allows different methods to work its actions into magic: knowing one method \nof Performance Magic does not let the magus use any other Ability in magic. It is \nthe action or words of the practice that are the focus of this Virtue, not the products \nof craft-working. An Ability that is verbal (such as storytelling) replaces the words \nof spellcasting; similarly, an Ability that is physical (such as hunting) replaces \ngestures. An Ability that encompasses both verbal and physical aspects (such as music, \nor mumming (acting)) allows the performer more flexibility. The magus must actually \nperform the Ability to count as using this Virtue, and other Virtues or Mastery Abilities \ndo not remove that requirement. For example, he cannot sing silently, although he \ncan hunt silently. Words or gestures that are not being replaced by Performance Magic \nremain as normal mystical components of spell-casting: use the normal rules and adjustments \n(including Virtues such as Quiet Magic and Mastery Abilities such as Still Casting). \n The magus may choose to vocalize loudly, or move exaggeratedly, and gain the equivalent \nbonuses as for loud words or exaggerated gestures. Bystanders may notice this as \nunusual activity, and take interest where they might not otherwise.  New Duration: \nPerformance. The spell lasts as long as the caster performs the Performance Ability. \nPerformance is equivalent to Concentration Duration. To cast a Performance Duration \nspell, the magus must succeed in a roll (simple or stress die, according to circumstances) \nof Characteristic (varies with Ability) + Ability against an Ease Factor of 3. The \nspell fails if this fails, and botches if the roll botches. The spell ends when the \nmagus ceases to perform the Ability, but no Concentration or Ability rolls are needed \nto maintain the spell while the performance continues.

    "meritDesc": "Faerie rites allow faerie wizards to damage a target directly, like the faeries whose\npower they channel. Consequently, Woe can cause grave injuries with greater ease \nthan Hermetic magic. However, because of the universal properties of faerie rites, \nthis damage immediately goes away as soon as the effect wears off. Those who wield \nthis power thus usually seek to harass and delude their quarry with their rites rather \nthan simply destroying them. And of course, it is generally much easier to simply \ncut off their enemies heads once they are disoriented. Choosing this Virtue gives \nthe character Woe with an initial score of 1.
